**Welcome to the Basu Neuro Lab.**  
Our lab is broadly interested in the neural mechanisms underlying navigation and decision-making. In particular, we investigate how the brain constructs internal maps of the surrounding environment, and how these maps are used to support flexible and goal-directed navigational behavior.
