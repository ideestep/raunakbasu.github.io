  <h1>Neural Mechanisms of Navigation and Decision-Making</h1>
  <p>
    The Basu Neuro Lab investigates how the brain constructs internal maps of the world and
    uses them to guide flexible behavior and decisions. We take an interdisciplinary approach
    combining systems neuroscience, behavior, and computational analysis.

      <h2>Research Focus</h2>
      <p>
        Our work aims to understand how neural circuits encode spatial environments and
        how these representations support planning, inference, and decision-making.

      <h2>Methods</h2>
      <p>
        We use behavioral tasks, in-vivo recordings, imaging, and computational modeling
        to study navigation-related cognition in controlled and naturalistic settings.

      <h2>Join the Lab</h2>
      <p>
        We are always interested in motivated students and collaborators with backgrounds
        in neuroscience, engineering, physics, or computer science.
