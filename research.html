    <p>
      Our lab aims to understand how the brain constructs internal representations
      of the surrounding world and how these representations support flexible,
      goal-directed decision-making. To address these questions, we take a highly
      interdisciplinary approach combining behavioral paradigms, in vivo
      electrophysiology, neural perturbation techniques, and computational analyses.
    </p>

    <p>
      Broadly, our work is organized around three interconnected research directions.

      <h3>Task-relevant cognitive map formation</h3>
      <p>
        Effective decision-making requires representations that extend beyond
        physical space. We investigate how the brain forms cognitive maps that
        integrate abstract variables such as value, cost, and context, and how
        these representations adapt to changing task demands.

      <h3>Neural basis of spatial decisions</h3>
      <p>
        Spatial decisions often depend on information that is not immediately
        available to the senses. We examine how internal representations of space,
        goals, and outcomes are used to evaluate trade-offs and guide navigation
        and choice.

    <article class="research-block">
      <h3>Coordination between distributed maps</h3>
      <p>
        Flexible behavior relies on interactions across multiple brain regions.
        Our work focuses on how distinct spatial and non-spatial maps are coordinated
        across neural circuits to support navigation and planning in complex,
        dynamic environments.
