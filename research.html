  <section class="research-intro">
    <p>
      Our lab aims to understand how the brain constructs internal representations
      of the surrounding world and how these representations support flexible,
      goal-directed decision-making. We take an interdisciplinary approach combining
      behavioral paradigms, in vivo electrophysiology, neural perturbation techniques,
      and computational analysis.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our work is organized around three interconnected research themes.

      <h3>Task-Relevant Cognitive Map Formation</h3>
      <p>
        Adaptive behavior requires more than a physical map of space.
        We investigate how neural circuits construct task-relevant
        cognitive maps that encode abstract variables such as value,
        context, and expected outcomes, and how these maps update when
        task contingencies change.
      </p>

    <article class="research-block">
      <h3>Neural Basis of Spatial Decision-Making</h3>
      <p>
        Spatial choices often rely on internally maintained representations
        rather than immediate sensory input. We study how representations
        of goals, spatial structure, and reward expectations interact
        to guide navigation and flexible decision-making.

    <article class="research-block">
      <h3>Coordination Between Distributed Neural Maps</h3>
      <p>
        Flexible planning depends on coordinated activity across multiple
        brain regions. Our research focuses on how distributed spatial
        and non-spatial representations interact across neural circuits
        to enable navigation, inference, and adaptive behavior in
        dynamic environments.
