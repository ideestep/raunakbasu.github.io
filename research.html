<!-- INTRO TEXT -->
<section class="research-intro">
  <p>
    Our lab aims to understand how the brain maps the surrounding world,
    which can facilitate informed decision-making. To address these questions,
    we take a highly interdisciplinary approach that involves behavioral training,
    in vivo electrophysiology, the use of neural perturbation techniques,
    and neural data analysis.
  </p>

  <p>
    Broadly, we are pursuing three interconnected research directions.

    <h3>Investigating task-relevant cognitive map formation</h3>
    <p>
      Imagine you have undertaken the impossible task of choosing the perfect
      restaurant for date night. To achieve this, you need a map of the highly
      rated restaurants in the city – not just a spatial map of where each
      restaurant is located, but also information about the quality of food,
      service, cost etc.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="column">
    <h3>Studying spatial decisions</h3>
    <p>
      How does the brain juggle between costs and benefits? These decisions are
      unique because all the relevant information is usually beyond one’s
      sensory perception and hence need to be based on internal maps.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="column">
    <h3>Interplay between spatial maps</h3>
    <p>
      One of the hallmarks of intelligence is our ability to flexibly navigate
      through an ever-changing world. We aim to answer how different maps across
      the brain coordinate to enable navigation in complex environments.
